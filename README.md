# Org-Chart-Convertor
As part of Hackpions â€“ EY GDS Hackathon, built a Image to text convertor
## Overview:

An organizational chart is a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions, jobs, etc. Leverage the power of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in image recognition technology to convert organizational charts into a simpler textual format.

## Task:

Propose and design a solution to scan organizational charts in different formats (PDF, MS Word and Excel, image, etc.) consisting of flowcharts and shapes like an arrow showing parent-to-child entity relationship
Extract details like child and parent entity, ownership percentage, country, etc. from a flow-chart/diagram
Convert the content into an Excel format
